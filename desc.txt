<h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Since I was a child, I was drawn to technology. I was the typical
            tech kid that loved videogames, gadgets and all the tech stuff that
            was booming out.

            Living in a country who encourages you to follow traditional
            lifestyles, my good grades made me start my path in med school,
            which lasted eight years. But you know that feeling that something
            is not right? I wasn’t feeling accomplished, I didn’t feel happy, at
            least not entirely.

            I took a break and decided to think about what my genuine self was
            passioned about, when a friend told me about Udacity. Honestly, it
            was love at first sight. I started looking the immense list of
            awesome courses, trying to understand which could fit me better, but
            it was easy though. It hooked me as soon as I read “Android
            Courses”.

            Guys, that magic of developing your first simple “Hello World” app
            and make it run on your phone is just unforgettable. The more I
            learnt, the more I started to invest that knowledge in my field,
            healthcare. When Google Scholarship was announced, it was an
            exciting opportunity to “make things official” with Udacity, Google
            and Android.Once that friend that introduced me to this world also
            got the Google Scholarship we started working together developing an
            healthcare product.
